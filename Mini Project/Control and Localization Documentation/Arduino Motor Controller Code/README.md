# Arduino Motor Controller
This folder contains the Arduino code developed for the motor controller in the mini project. The files with "V#" are renditions of the motor controller that were used for debugging, drafting, and testing the controller. "FinalDemoController" is the finalized motor controller that includes computer vision integration to be used for the mini project demo.
