# Localization and Control
This folder contains the Arduino and MATLAB code developed for the robot to move and turn accordingly. The purpose of the code is to allow the robot to receive information from a Raspberry Pi to locate and move toward (and circle) around an Aruco marker. The code in the "Arduino Controller Code" folder contains the code that will run for both tasks 1 and 2 based on a setting of a single boolean variable. The MATLAB code contains the code used to test the controller parameters and ensure the controller will behave correctly.
