# Computer Vision
This folder contains the updated Python code used for the Raspberry Pi to detect an Aruco marker. The code detects a marker using a web camera where it will determine the angle and position the marker is away from the camera. This data will be sent to the Arduino in order to move and turn the robot accordingly.
